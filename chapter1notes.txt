Software Engineering:
	Two key phrases
		Engineering Discipline
		All aspects of software production

	Necessary product characteristics:
		Acceptability
		Dependability and security
		Efficiency
		Maintainability

	SE important for two reasons:
		individuals and society rely on advanced software systems, we need to be able to produce reliable and trustworthy systems economically and quickly
		it's usually cheaper to use swe methods and techniques for professional software systems rather than just write programs as a personal programming projects

	Four fundamental activities common to all software processes
		software specification
		software development
		software validation
		software evolution

	Four related issues that affect many different types of software:
		heterogeneity
		business and social change
		security and trust
		scale software

	Many different types of application
		stand-alone applications
		interactive transaction-based applications
		embedded control systems
		batch processing systems
		entertainment systems
		systems for modeling and simulation
		data collection and analysis systems
		system of systems

		boundaries between these system types are blurred
		Ex: if you develop a game for a phone, you take into account the same constraints (power, hardware interaction) as the devs of the phone software

		each system type requires specialized software engineering techniques because software has different characteristics
		Ex: embedded control system in an automobile is safety-critical and is burned into ROM when installed in vehicle

	
	Software engineering fundamentals that apply to all types of software systems:
		
		should be developed using a managed and understood development process. The organization developing the software should plan the development process and have clear ideas of what will be produced and when completed (specific process depends on type of software being developed)

		dependability and performance always important, should behave as expected, w/o failures, available when required. safe in operation, secure against attack. efficient, no waste of resources

		understand and manage software spec. and requirements. know different customers and use expectations

		effective use of existing resources, i.e. reuse software that's been developed instead of writing new software

	Web now used extensively, with cloud-based software and applications dominating the market
	This had led to major effects on swe for web-based systems:
		software reused is dominant approach for web-based systems
		impractical to specify all requirements for systems in advance; web-based systems are always developed and delivered incrementally
		software may be implemented using service-oriented swe, where software components are stand=-alone web services
		interface dev tech such as AJAX ad HTML5 have emerged that support creation of rich interfaces within a web browser

	Standards of acceptable behavior:
		confidentiality
		competence
		intellectual property rights
		computer misuse

	NO absolutes when it comes to safety
	ethical issues always exist
	when collaborating, make views known in advance
	
	examples of system types:
		embedded system
			system where software controls hardware device that's embedded in that device
			issues in emb. systems include physical size, responsiveness, power management.
			ex: insulin pump for ppl with diabetes
		information system
			purpose to manage and provide access to database of info. issues include security, usability, privacy, maintaining data integrity
			ex: medical records system
		sensor-based data collection system
			collect data from a set of sensors and to process data in some way. requirements are reliability and maintainability, even in hostile environment/conditions
			ex: wilderness weather station
		support environment
			integrated collection of software tools used to support some activity
			programming environments
			ex: digital learning env to support students learning in school

Insulin pump control system:
	medical system that simulates operation of the pancreas
	software controlling this is: embedded system: that collects info from sensor and controls a pump that delivers a controlled dose of insulin to user
	problem: level of insulin does not just depend on blood glucose level but also on time of last insulin injection. irregular checking can lead to low levels of blood glucose

	Software controlled insulin delivery system uses a microsensor embedded in the patient to measure some blood parameter that is proportional to the sugar level, which is then sent to the pump controller. This controller computes the sugar level and the amount of insulin needed, then sends signal to a miniaturized pump to deliver the insulin via a permanently attached needle

	The pump delivers one unit of insulin in response to a single pulse from a controller. Therefore, to deliver 10 units of insulin, controller sends 10 pulses to the pump
	Diagram "Activity model of the insulin pump" is a Unified Modeling Language (UML) that illustrates how software transforms an input blood sugar level to a sequence of commands that drive the insulin pump
	This is a safety-critical system
	System must meet two essential high-level requirements:
		System shall be available to deliver insulin when required
		System shall perform reliably and deliver the correct amount of insulin to counteract the current level of blood sugar
	So, system must be designed and implemented to ensure it always meets above requirements

Patient Information System for Mental Health Care
	Ex name: Mentcare
	A patient information system that is intended for use in clinics; makes use of centralized database of patient information but has also been designed to run on a laptop, may be accessed wand used from sites that do not have secure network connectivity
	When local systems have secure net access, they use patient info in database, but can download and use local copies of patient records when they are disconnected
	Is not complete medical records system and does not maintain info about other medical conditions
	May interact and exchange data with other clinical info systems
	This system has two purposes:
		Generate management info that allows health service managers to assess performance against local and government targets
		provide medical staff with timely info to support the treatment of patients
	Key features of system:
		individual care management:
			clinicians can create records for patients, edit info in system, view patient history.
			system supports data summaries so doctors can quickly learn about key problems and treatments that have no been prescribed
		patient monitoring:
			system regularly monitors records of patients that are involved in treatment, and issues warnings if possible problems detected, so if patient has not seen doctor for a time, warning may be issued. one of most important elements of monitoring system is keep track of patients who have been sectioned and to ensure the legally required checks are carried out at right time
		administrative reporting:
			system generates monthly management reports showing number of patients treated at each clinic, number of patients who've entered and left care system, number of patients sectioned, drugs prescribed and their cost, etc.

2 different laws affect system:
	laws on data protection that govern confidentiality of personal info
	mental health laws that govern the compulsory detention of patients deemed to be a danger to themself or others
	
	Privacy is very critical
	Privacy is easiest to maintain when there's only a single copy of the system data.
	However, to ensure availability in the event of server failure or disconnection from network, multiple copies of the data should be maintained

	
A Wilderness Weather Station
	Help monitor and improve accuracy of weather forecasts in remote areas, the government of the country decides to deploy several hundred weather stations in remote areas. These stations collect data from a set of instruments that measure temperature and pressure, sunshine, rainfall, wind speed and direction

	Systems:
		Weather Station System:
			This system is responsible for collecting weather data, carrying out some initial data processing, and transmitting it to the data management system
		Data Management and Archiving System
			This system collects the data from all of the wilderness weather stations, carries out data processing and analysis, and archives the data in a form that can be retrieved by other systems, such as weather forecasting systems
		Station Maintenance System
			This system can communicate by satellite with all wilderness stations to monitor the health of these systems and provide reports of problems, this system can also be used to remotely control the weather station

	UML package symbol to indicate that each system is a collection of components and the separate systems are identified using the UML stereotype <<system>>
	Each station is battery-powered and must be entirely self-contained; no external power or network cables. All communications are through a relatively slow satellite link, and station must include some mechanism (solar or wind power) to charge its batteries.
	Station software must not be concerned only with data collection, but must also:
		Monitor the instruments, power, and communication hardware and report faults to the management system
		Manage the system power, ensuring that batteries are charged whenever the environmental conditions permit but also that generators are shut down in potentially damaging weather conditions, such as high wind
		Allow for dynamic reconfig where parts of the software are replaced with new versions and where backup instruments are switched into the system in the event of system failure


Digital Learning Environment for Schools
	Three types of service in this system:
		Utility Services
			provide basic application-independent functionality and that may be used by other services in the system. Utility services are usually developed or adapted specifically for this system
		Application Services
			provide specific applications such as email, conferencing, photo sharing, etc, and access to specific educational content such as scientific films or historical resources. app services are external services that are either specifically purchased for the system or are available freely over the internet
		Configuration Services
			used to adapt the environment with a specific set of application services and to define how services are shared between students, teachers, and their parents

Spreadsheet	Virtual Learning environment	History archive

Utility Services
Authentication		Logging and monitoring		Interfacing
User Storage		Application Storage		Search

This environment is designed so that services can be replaced as new services become available and to provide different versions of the system that are suited for the age of the users. This means that the system has to support two levels of service integration:
	Integrated Services
		are services that offer an API (application programming interface) and that can be accessed by other services through that API. Direct service-to-service communication is therefore possible. An authentication service is an example of an integrated service. authentication service can be called on by other services to authenticate users. If users are already authenticated, then the authentication service may pass authentication info directly to another service, via an API, with no need for users to reauthenticate themselves
	Independent Services
		services that are accessed through a browser interface and that operate independently of other services. Info can only be shared with other services through explicit user actions such as copy and paste; reauth may be required for each independent service
